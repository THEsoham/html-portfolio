<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from
    their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him
    everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea
    in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every
    move.</p>


<h3>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</h3>
<p>When Austria's crown prince is found dead, evidence seems to point to suicide. However, detective Sherlock Holmes
    (Robert Downey Jr.) deduces that the prince was murdered and that the crime is but a piece of a puzzle designed by
    an evil genius named Moriarty (Jared Harris). Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson (Jude Law), who are accompanied by a
    Gypsy (Noomi Rapace) whose life Holmes saved, chase Moriarty across Europe in the hope that they can thwart his plot
    before it can come to fruition.</p>

<h3>Colorful</h3>
<p>There is a train station on the other side of death, yet not all who arrive on the platform will be judged ready for
    passage onwards. For one unready soul, there will be both a test and a second chance. Rather than be reborn, this
    soul will awake in the body of 14-year-old suicide Makoto Kobayashi where it must not only find a way to fit into
    Makoto's existence, but also unravel two mysteries. What is the secret of the great sin it committed in its own
    previous life and what were the reasons that led to Makoto's suicide? While some may believe the truth to be as
    plain to see as black and white, "Makoto" soon finds that the real world is overlaid with so many shades of grey and
    rainbows of colors that even the most obvious of "facts" are not what they seem. With the soul's time in Makoto's
    body quickly running out, the answers to all life's mysteries await discovery.</p>
